pleaase is transitively vulnerable to GHSA-9v62-24cr-58cx from its node-sass dependency

This package depends on a vulnerable version of `node-sass` (~4.5.0)

It invokes the vulnerable JS Function (`renderSync`) [1] which eventually calls the vulnerable native function.

I haven't investigated the extent to which this is exploitable from pleaaase.
