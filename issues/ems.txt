Division by zero when env var. EMS_Ntasks is 0 and ntasks arg is <=0

### Problem
When the the call to initialize() from JS provides ntasks <= 0, the code falls back to using the value from the env. var EMS_Ntasks, without checking if it's > 0.

As a result, we get a division by zero in C function EMSInitialize() [2].

### How to Reproduce

1. Create a file named test.js, with the following content:
```
process.env.EMS_Ntasks = "0";
var x = require('ems')(0)
```
2. Run:
```
$ node test.js

Floating point exception (core dumped)
```

### Proposed Fix

Ensure that nTasks is always > 0. After reading the env var, check its value.
